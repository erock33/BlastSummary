BlastSummary
------------

BlastSummary takes a set of sequences in fasta format and runs them through blast against NCBI's nr. It outputs an sqlite database containing a summary of the results.

The fasta file may contain multiple sequences. For each sequence, blast will be
run and a row will be added to the database.

Data is stored in the BlastSummary table, with this schema:
    id:             (Integer) Primary Key
    query_id:       (Text)    Query sequence identifier
    query_length:   (Integer) Length of query sequence
    num_alignments: (Integer) Total number of alignments returned
    total_hsps:     (Integer) Total number of hsps across all alignments
    num_hsps:       (Integer) Number of hsps in best alignment
    best_score:     (Real)    Score of best hsp
    best_expect:    (Real)    Expect of best hsp
    best_align_id:  (Text)    Hit identifier of the top scoring alignment
    best_align_def: (Text)    Hit definition of the top scoring alignment
    
The best alignment and best hsp are found by looking for the hsp with the highest score and lowest expect, in that order.
